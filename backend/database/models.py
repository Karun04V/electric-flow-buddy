# This file will define your database table structures.
# We'll use placeholder comments for now.
# In a real project, you would use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy.

# Example for the 'users' table:
# class User:
#     id: int (Primary Key)
#     organization_id: int (Foreign Key to organizations)
#     name: str
#     email: str (Unique)
#     password_hash: str
#     role: str (e.g., 'admin', 'manager')

# Example for the 'bus_telemetry' table:
# class BusTelemetry:
#     id: int (Primary Key)
#     bus_id: int (Foreign Key to buses)
#     timestamp: datetime
#     latitude: float
#     longitude: float
#     battery_soc: float
#     passenger_count: int

print("Database models would be defined here.")
